        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Jacob!</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Jacob Myers, a cybersecurity student at UT 
Austin. This blog/showcase is an example of one of our first projects. 
On this page, I'll discuss 
	    some of the methods surrounding the creation of the site, as well 
as some cybersecurity related news I feel is important for others to 
become familiar with. 
            <br><br>
            This web application was deployed using a pre-configured 
docker container within the Azure Cloud web-app service. Afterward, the 
HTML configurations were manually configured 
	    to personalize the page and create the blog below. Afterward, a key
 vault was created (then secured) and a self-signed certificate was made
 and bound to the application. Finally, 
   	    Azure Front Door was implemented as well as a web application 
firewall then subsequently configured. Security Center recommendations 
were analyzed and remediated.

                <h3>Could Chat GPT Become a Security Threat?</h3>
                <h4>Phishing, ChatGPT, AI</h4>
                <p>ChatGPT, or Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer, 
is a new language processing artificial intelligence that can generate 
responses 
		   that sounds eerily human-like. ChatGPT is a transformative 
breakthrough for many. Marketing firms are able to use the AI to get the
 
		   ball rolling on advertisements. If needed, the AI can even produce 
code for development, scripting, and much more. Or, if desired, it 
		   can discuss philosophical concepts. Overall, this tool can increase
 productivity exponentially if used properly. 
		   <br><br>		
                   However, with ChatGPT's incredible intelligence, it 
could potentially pose a security-related threat in the near future. For
 instance, 
		   bad actors could use ChatGPT's language skills to develop 
sophisticated, human-like phishing emails. It could become difficult for
 
  		   people in the workforce to differentiate, as previous indicators 
of phishing may be elimated with the introduction of ChatGPT. It's worth
 noting 
		   that I used ChatGPT to brainstorm for this very blog!

                <h3>LastPass Notifies User of Breach</h3>
                <h4>Encryption, Password Management</h4>
                <p>
                    On December 22nd of 2022, the well-known password 
manager, LastPass, notified users of a breach resulting in the 
		    intrusion of archived backup storage. The threat actor was able to
 obtain a cloud storage access key as well as 
		    a dual storage container decryption key. As a result of this 
breach, the threat actor was able to copy information 
		    from the backup that contained basic customer information such as 
customer names, names of end-users, billing addresses, 
		    email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses associated with 
the end-user. 
		    <br><br>
		    Most importantly, the threat actor was able to copy data from the backup customer data vault. It's important to note that 
		    the data from this vault contained unencrypted links to website URLs associated with passwords. However, the passwords 
		    and usernames associated with the URLs are encrypted via 256-bit AES encryption. This breach reaches as far 
		    back as August of 2022 when LastPass claimed its front-end was compromised. It's become quite clear that this breach 
		    has gone much farther than the company has intended. Personally, once informed of this breach, have changed password 
		    managers.
